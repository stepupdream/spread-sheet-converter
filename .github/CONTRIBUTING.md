# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**. We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/stepupdream/spread-sheet-converter).

## Pull Requests

- We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
- SpreadSheetConverter follows the [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) coding standard and the [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) autoloading standard.
  Don't worry if your code styling isn't perfect! StyleCI will automatically merge any style fixes into the Laravel repository after pull requests are merged. This allows us to focus on the content of the contribution and not the code style.
- Please be sure to add more tests. Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- Please create a feature branch from the develop branch.
- Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.
